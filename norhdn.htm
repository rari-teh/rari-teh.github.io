		<h1>～anonymous patch library～</h1>
		<p class="intro">It’s been a long time since Romhacking.net became the
 undisputed Nº 1 website for unofficial game patches, hacks and 
translations alike. Granted, there is a handful of exceptions &#8211; some 
games manage to cultivate big enough romhacking communities around them 
to warrant their own walled gardens of patch websites, such as 
SMWCentral for <i>Super Mario World</i>; the PC game modding scene works
 almost in parallel altogether; and that statement swiftly crumbles once
 the scope is broadened to the non-English-speaking Internet &#8211; but the 
fact remains that if there’s a console game that has never seen an 
official release in English, the first thing the informed prospective 
player will do is probably look it up on RHDN to see if a fan 
translation exists, and if there is a game that was released in English,
 but rife with censorship, bad voice acting or downright bad 
translation, the place to look at is also, without a shadow of doubt, 
RHDN. That is a fact that is pretty well-known.</p>
		<p class="intro">What might not be as well-known, however, is that 
it’s also been a long time since Romhacking.net has stopped allowing the
 upload of patches of anonymous or unknown authorship. While their 
motives are transparent and very understandable (quote, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/policy/#Hacks">“this option led to too many hacks with inadequate information”</a>),
 this has the unfortunate side effect of leaving a number of earlier 
works whose authorship for one reason or another has been lost to the 
sands of time and didn’t make it to the website before the ban without 
an easily-reachable place to be preserved. This page hopes to aid in 
remedying that &#8211; while I’m well aware that the impact of an HTML file on
 the personal website of a particular nobody is less than optimal, it’s 
at the very least a guarantee that there’ll be one more page with one 
more copy findable on search engines.</p>
		<p class="intro">If you know of any other translation, undub or 
romhack alike of lost authorship, I ask you to kindly send an email to 
mainbox at this domain and I’ll gladly add it to this page.</p>

		<h2>Conker’s Bad Fur Day</h2>
		<h3>uncensoring hack</h3>
		<h3>System:<em> Nintendo 64</em></h3>
		<h3>Version:<em> NTSC-U</em></h3>
		<h3>Original ROM CRC32:<em> CE8CC172</em></h3>
		<h3><a href="ref/anon/conker.bps">Download</a></h3>
		<p class="desc">The existence of an uncensored version of <i>Conker</i>
 had long been fabled, but stayed highly elusive until July 2021, when a
 dump of an uncensored repro cart sold on Etsy was uploaded to Mega and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/oeh8wc/conkers_bad_fur_day_uncensored_n64/">posted on r/n64</a> by u/DarkMadman_69. The patch available here is in BPS format and should be applied to the big-endian No-Intro ROM.</p>

		<h2>Dragon Ball Z: Gokuu Gekitouden</h2>
		<h3>English translation</h3>
		<h3>System:<em> Game Boy</em></h3>
		<h3>Version:<em> Japan</em></h3>
		<h3>Original ROM CRC32:<em> FF3C027D</em></h3>
		<h3><a href="ref/anon/gekitouden.ips">Download</a></h3>
		<p class="desc">Numerous attempts have been made by fans to translate 
this allegedly amazing RPG and none managed to make it far, all for the 
same reason: the almost entirety of the game’s text is stored with such 
unique custom compression that it seems to be inscrutable to anyone but 
whoever at Bandai coded it in the remote days of 1995. That was the 
consensus until October 2016, when a pirate cartridge of the game fully 
translated to English was dumped and <a href="https://hhug.me/?post=68">posted online by Handheld Underground</a>.
 Whatever black magic was used to compress the text, the Chinese pirates
 were able to crack back in the day. The one downside is that the game 
was translated by the same people behind the <i>Pok&#233;mon Diamond</i> and <i>Jade</i> hacks of <i>Telefang</i>,
 and that piece of information should set your expectations for the 
quality of the text. It’s an unignorable fact that we’ve come to expect 
impeccable standards when it comes to video game translations over the 
course of the decades &#8211; call it being spoiled or finally demanding the 
new art to be treated with the respect it deserves, the fact remains 
that playing a game that was clearly translated by a non-speaker with a 
dictionary in this day and age is, at the very least, jarring &#8211; and <i>Bahamut Lagoon</i>
 this is not. Still, in Keiji Inafune’s immortal words, it’s better than
 nothing. This patch also incorporates the hack by taizou to make it 
compatible with all emulators.</p>

		<h2><a name="popprincess">Kira Kira Pop Princess</a></h2>
		<h3>undub</h3>
		<h3>System:<em> Nintendo DS</em></h3>
		<h3>Version:<em> Europe</em></h3>
		<h3>Original ROM CRC32:<em> 89200C0E</em></h3>
		<h3><a href="ref/anon/popprincess_undub.xdelta">Download</a></h3>
		<p class="desc">This undub’s origins are a mystery: all I know is that
 it used to circulate on Megaupload in pre-patched form, as these things
 usually were back then, and it even got linked to at <i><a href="https://vsrecommendedgames.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_DS">/v/’s Recommended Games</a></i>
 at one point, but it seemed to vanish together with Megaupload. Adding 
to its rarity, many ROM websites erroneously label the equally anonymous
 undub of <a href="#poptown">its sequel</a> as the one for <i>Kira Kira Pop Princess</i>.
 In 2020, I managed to find a copy on a Russian website whose name I 
forgot to take note of (Emu-Land, possibly?), present here in xdelta patch form. It might be 
worthy of note that this patch somehow makes the ROM over 50% smaller, 
but I have no idea what it does away with.</p>

		<h2><a name="cock">Pokémon: Cock Version</a></h2>
		<h3>comedy hack</h3>
		<h3>System:<em> Game Boy</em></h3>
		<h3>Version:<em> America/Europe</em></h3>
		<h3>Original ROM CRC32:<em> 9F7FDD53 (<i>Pokémon: Red Version</i>)</em></h3>
		<h3><a href="ref/anon/cock.ips">Download</a></h3>
		<p class="desc">Yes! This 2000s-as-hell hack has a doubtlessly interesting story that has been mostly lost to time. I’d guess sometime during the genI Pokémon romhack boom, when easy-to-use hacking tools were first released, making possible the development of simple hacks with minimal to no programming expertise required, someone made a highly edgy overly sexual <i>Pokémon Red</i> text romhack, made the Poké Marts sell master balls for ₽0 and removed obstacles all around Kanto to make it quick to play the game through, and then probably posted it on a now-defunct Pokémon forum. Not too long after, someone somewhere with access to grey market supply chains stumbled upon it and thought it’d be a good idea to have repro carts made of it. While the Internet moved on from its sophomoric allure, letting the download links rot away without reuploads as forums died and early cloud storage services closed down, the pirates kept marching on, churning copies out year after year and selling them at the usual copyright-infringing suspects. Were these carts supposed to be sold as an urban legend, a secret official Pokémon game, perhaps riding off the wave of then-popular creepypastas like <a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Black"><i>Pokémon Black</i></a>? Or were they always supposed to be a joke item, naught but a curio to amuse friends who may peruse your Game Boy cart collection, as it seems to be sold today? Someone probably knows, but that someone definitely isn’t me. In 2016, a person by the name of Zeipher, who owned one of those repro carts, noticed that this clearly Internet-originated romhack seemed to have fallen off the face of its homeland and took their time to dump it and <a href="http://bootleg.games/BGC_Forum/index.php?topic=1614.0">post it to the Bootleg Games Central Forum</a>, making it once again available for the price it’s worth.</p>

		<h3>Original ROM CRC32:<em> FC0118A6</em></h3>
		<h3><a href="ref/anon/poptown_undub.xdelta">Download</a></h3>
		<p class="desc">The story is very similar to that of <i><a href="#popprincess">Kira Kira Pop Princess</a></i>,
 even down to being linked to by /v/, but this is much easier to find as
 a pre-patched ROM. Despite that, it still warrants archiving.</p>
