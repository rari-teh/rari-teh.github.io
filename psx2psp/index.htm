		<h1>～rari’s custom PSP EBOOT skins～</h1>
		<p class="intro">Here are all the EBOOT asset packs I’ve made for myself!
		All modesty aside, I think they’re pretty high quality – besides using
		official art for the backgrounds with no distortion or bad upscaling, all
		of them feature background music as well, which most PSX2PSP collections
		omit.</p>
		
		<p>I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/XyLe-GBP/ATRACTool-Reloaded" target="_top">ATRACTool-Reloaded</a> to convert the BGM to AT3.
		As always, to play multi-track games, I recommend joining the BIN files with
		<a href="https://www.videohelp.com/software/CDMage" target="_top">CDMage</a> and using the <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/CDDA_Enabler_PSP" target="_top">CDDA Enabler</a> plugin.</p>

		<h2>CARDGAMESYUU</h2>
		<h3>SuperLite 3in1 Pack Series</h3>
		<h3><em>Success, 2002</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">I’m a sucker for card games, and this collection of
		Success’ best from their budget series is great. It includes a good
		blackjack and a good koi-koi, which alone would be enough to keep
		me entertained for an astonishingly long time, but this disc also
		includes poker, pyramid, speed, oicho-kabu, hana-awase, hachi-hachi and
		also much less brilliantly concentration and tycoon. Whatever points were
		deducted by the crappiness of concentration, which is barely a card
		game if you ask me, are quickly made back up by the third title in
		this 3 in 1 value pack: <i>Angolmois 99</i>, a game in which one of
		Nostradamus’ prophecies is fulfilled and that means you, as a space
		angel that looks an awful lot like David Bowie, have to play knockoff
		Uno against Bill Clinton in order to usher in the end times. <a href="../img/misc/angolmois.png">Seriously.</a></p>
		
		<p class="desc">There’s also an alternate background I made earlier
		with much cleaner graphics, all nicked from the cover art itself, but
		I think that the Y2K aesthetics of the title screen go too hard to be
		ignored. Mouseover the sample picture to see the alternate background –
		it’s included in the regular download.</p>

		<h2>Cleopatra Fortune</h2>
		<h3><em>Altron, 2001</em></h3>
		<p class="desc"><i>Cleopatra Fortune</i> is one of my favourite games
		ever, and anything I own that can play video games must have a copy of
		it to be complete. Sadly, no current fork of MAME or FinalBurn
		on the PSP has an implementation of the arcade version, so Altron’s very
		much imperfect PlayStation port has to do. I mean, it’s not <i>bad</i>,
		I don’t think any Altron game is, but if you’re used to the arcade version
		you know this isn’t the real thing as soon as you grasp the controller.
		I run the Japanese version because, well, <i>Cleopatra Fortune</i> isn’t <i>Cleopatra Fortune</i>
		without the screen-tall Patra-ko drawings you get when you manage to clear
		the board. The American version had those removed, and the PAL version was made by the worst of budget publishers
		that managed to break the game’s sound, and everybody knows that <i>Cleopatra
		Fortune</i> isn’t <i>Cleopatra Fortune</i> without <i>Shinin’ Queen</i>.</p>

		<h2>Finger Flashing</h2>
		<h3><em>Affect, 1999</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">A delightfully whimsical little puzzly shmup with rock-paper-scissors mechanics that never left Japan. If you
		don’t speak Japanese, by all means use the <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/266/">fan translation</a> by RIP –
		as the worryingly low RHDN ID number may hint, it may be ancient and have released while the game could still be found brand new in shops
		if you were Japanese enough, but it’s worth it. This game used to have
		<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100612125949/http://www.affect.co.jp/ff/ff.htm">a dedicated minisite</a> that was up right until Affect’s demise on the early 2010s,
		but tragically, many of the pictures it had including the entire illustration gallery
		went unarchived.</p>

		<h2>Harmful Park</h2>
		<h3><em>Sky Think System, 1997</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">This is one of those games that were made by a tiny company, printed in very low
		numbers and sold very little to almost no reception whatsoever, only to garner
		a massive cult following over the years and drive the price of secondhand copies to
		the moon. This is, by many accounts, the definitive parody shooter, featuring all sorts of
		gimmicks and ridiculous visuals and effects to gawk at. Despite being an endeavour from a
		small, unestablished developer, it is a very polished game, with excellent art, wacky voice acting
		that was probably done by random programmers who used to go to theater club and a soundtrack that
		just begs for a CD release that never came. Sky Think System, the company that not only developed but also self-published
		<i>Harmful Park</i>, were apparently an IT company offering a motley collection of products
		that ranged from the three games they developed and published, to a gaming tips hotline,
		to printing and imaging services, to network services aimed at educational institutions, if their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971211105011/http://www.sts.co.jp/">website</a> was to be believed.
		They eventually dropped off the games market, became <a href="http://skygroup.jp/">SKY Group</a> and
		are still trading to this day, only ever so briefly looking back during the PSP/PS3 era when they
		rereleased their entire three game library on the Japanese PSN under the name <a href="http://skysea-games.jp/">SKYSEA Games</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="desc">This one also has an alternate background, made with material from the 1997
		press release. Mouseover the sample image to take a peek.</p>

		<h2>Incredible Crisis</h2>
		<h3><em>Polygon Magic, 1999</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">It’s hard to believe that this extremely Japanese comedy game
		made it outside of Japan, but it sure did. It’s a delightful minigame rush that
		has you go through a very much not average day in a traditional Japanese family
		and the less said before you play it, the best. I have no idea what this game’s
		budget was, but I imagine Tokuma Shoten had quite a few bucks to blow on this one,
		considering the superb character work and the real, actual philharmonic they
		hired for the soundtrack. Titus’ American conversion omits two minigames, but
		only because they inherently depend on the way the Japanese language is written,
		so it was sensible to cut what you can’t properly translate.</p>
		
		<p class="desc">There’s also an alternate background if you don’t fancy the very yellow one I
		liked best (hover the mouse to see).</p>

		<h2>Jumping Flash!</h2>
		<h3><em>Exact, 1995</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">3D platforming is one of those things that we take so much for
		granted nowadays that it’s easy to forget there was an entire journey to get it figured
		out. The first 3D platformer ever made, <i>Geograph Seal</i>, played almost completely
		differently from what we’re used to nowadays: despite the tank controls, it had a
		big emphasis on the jumping action, with the camera dramatically changing angles
		as you moved and jumped to great heights. While that trailblazing game would
		forever remain a Sharp X68k exclusive, the developers would go on to make a
		spiritual successor for the PlayStation, and that would be <i>Jumping Flash!</i>,
		the second 3D platformer ever made. It was this game that tragically inspired
		the ill-fated <i>Bubsy is 3D in Furbitten Planet</i>, but that’s only because
		this was literally all they had to work on. In the end, the design principles that
		would triumph over all others would be those born of the seminal <i>Super Mario 64</i>
		from the following year, maybe the first 3D platformer that <i>mattered</i>.
		Even franchises that were born of competing design philosophies such as <i>Crash Bandicoot</i>
		would later change into a Marioesque design. Such is the way of the art: the
		invention of new technology brings a creativity boom, and the passing of time
		brings a normalisation made through the survival of the fittest. But that doesn’t
		mean that <i>Jumping Flash!</i> is bad or outdated – in fact, my opinion is
		that it aged better than <i>Super Mario 64</i>, perhaps because Mario’s controls and
		physics and camera were refined over the course of many iterations from countless
		developers, while the high jumping, sharp shooting, enemy stomping fun from Exact
		remained fresh.</p>

		<h2>Jumping Flash! 2</h2>
		<h3><em>Exact, 1996</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">Like <i>Geograph Seal</i> before it, the original <i>Jumping Flash!</i>
		is a bit on the short side. This sequel is more of the same, which in this case
		is pretty welcome. The series also had a third game in <i>Robbit Mon Dieu!</i>,
		which was a lot different from the first two and featured quests and dialog and
		whatnot, but sadly that not only never left Japan but also never got fan translated.
		The gimmicky minigame rush PocketStation spinoff <i>Pocket MuuMuu</i> suffered a similar
		fate, though probably because the PocketStation never left Japan either.</p>

		<h2>Kitchen Panic</h2>
		<h3><em>Panther Software, 1998</em></h3>
		<p class="desc" style="cursor:url(../misc/kit_10.cur),auto;">This game has no relation to the other <i>Kitchen Panic</i> released
		by Coconuts on the Game Boy many years prior. This is a 2D platformer with
		wide, slightly labyrinthine levels and very, very cute graphics that
		made me instantly fall in love with it. The excuse plot is about kitchen utensils
		and foodstuffs becoming sentient and wreaking havoc and I don’t know much more
		about it other than that the tin cans are really cute. It’s quite a hard game, but the controls
		are very tight and fair, and if you get familiar enough with the stages, you
		can zip through with great speed across the kitchen. This was also released on Windows back then and,
		believe it or not, since Panther is still somehow alive, there’s now an
		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.interlex.kitchenpanic&hl=ja" style="cursor:url(../misc/kit_10.cur),auto;">Android version</a> that
		on a cursory glance of its files seems to be a straight port. Furthermore, like <i>Finger Flashing</i>,
		this game had a minisite… except Panther is still alive, so <a href="http://panther.co.jp/contents/game.htm" style="cursor:url(../misc/kit_10.cur),auto;">the
		pages are still up</a>, complete with the wallpapers and, incredibly, the icon pack!
		Remember when those were a thing? I don’t know what I’m going to use those for
		besides the cursor you are seeing on mouseover right now but I’ll eventually find out :3</p>

		<h2>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</h2>
		<h3><em>Namco, 1997</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">There are not enough words to describe
		how much I love this game. If you’re somehow not familiar with
		Klonoa, I urge you to drop everything you’re doing and play it now.
		Seriously, this is one of those games that are nothing what it looks
		like and discussing it for more than five minutes is impossible without
		walking into a spoiler. The PlayStation 2 sequel, <i>Klonoa 2: Lunatea’s Veil</i>,
		is arguably even better, revolving around… see, even if I say what the plot
		is about, that would be a spoiler. Just let it be known that it is extremely good
		and very emotional and that, if you have a modern console or a relatively high-end gaming PC, the
		<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730680/Klonoa_Phantasy_Reverie_Series/">recent remakes</a> are worth every penny (even if in my heart
		nothing	will ever beat the whimsical charm of the low-res spritework on low-poly landscapes
		of the PlayStation original). My only word of warning is to give the Wii remake
		a miss.</p>

		<h2>KulaQuest</h2>
		<h3><em>Game Design Sweden AB, 1998</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">I’m pretty sure someone nicked this game in the mid 2000s,
		because everybody I’ve ever talked to about this game – myself included –
		initially had vague memories of playing it on a browser with Adobe Flash on
		one of those old game websites. You’re a beach ball and you have to navigate
		yourself around a 3D structure, and gravity changes direction whenever you
		roll to an orthogonal side of the Escherian structure you’re on. It’s fun and challenging, but sadly
		the code isn’t as tight as the game requires: sometimes you have
		to jump while rolling several times in a row, and that will cause you to fall
		out of sync with the grid because the game engine they used was made for free
		movement like 99% of other 3D games and the programmers didn’t patch around
		it well enough. I play the Japanese version because it was the last one to
		be released and therefore, in this case, it is the one with the least amount
		of bugs and design oversights, and there’s no good reason to play the American
		nor the original PAL versions in this day and age.</p>

		<h2>Kururin PA!</h2>
		<h3><em>Sky Think System, 1995</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">If you’ve heard of Sky Think System, it’s probably because
		of <i>Harmful Park</i>, the seminal parody shmup that I’ve already droned
		about on this very page. That was the last of their three games. <i>Kururin
		PA!</i> was the first, and they showed that their talent wasn’t limited to
		shoot-’em-ups. Falling block puzzle games are my favourite genre of games
		that aren’t story driven, and while I love <i>Cleopatra Fortune</i>, absolutely
		nothing beats this game, and it baffles me that nobody seems to talk about it.
		Even pixiv has barely any fanart of it, despite it featuring a wacky cast of
		very ’90s world stereotypes that not very subtly take the mick out of <i>Street
		Fighter II</i>. The impromptu voice actors predictably make an anachronistic return, and if
		you’ve played <i>Harmful Park</i> before you’re guaranteed to have whiplash at
		certain voices being shared among very disparate characters. The gameplay is a mishmash of prior, questionably good titles
		that together make a ridiculously addictive game that makes hours fly by: the
		main blocks of the game are pieces of wick that you have to connect (like
		<a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1077/"><i>Gorby’s Pipeline</i></a>); there are bomb blocks that, when lit, set fire to all
		adjacent blocks (like <i>Panic Bomber</i>); and each character has a special
		item that behaves differently, one of which – the main character’s, Japanese
		schoolgirl Nana Kisaragi –, rolls in a straight path crushing all garbage
		blocks on its path (like <i>Pac-Attack</i>). It’s a brilliant game with a brilliant soundtrack
		that, once again, begs so much for a CD release that never came that each song
		actually has a title that you can see on the built-in sound test. One of the
		character themes is titled <i>Fuck You Crazy</i>, by the way, and I think that’s
		about everything you need to know about this game.</p>

		<h2>Um Jammer Lammy</h2>
		<h3><em>NanaOn-Sha, 1999</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">This is a game that shouldn’t bear introduction. After <i>PaRappa
		the Rapper</i> became a sensation, Rodney Greenblat and Sony followed their ~groovy~
		effort with a spinoff starring a rockstar guitarist lamb <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/interview-rodney-greenblat-the-mother-of-sony-s-almost-mario">inspired by Natalie Imbruglia</a>,
		as much as the artist wanted to keep it closer to PaRappa. It’s good wacky fun, the songs aren’t bad and the game has aged
		quite well despite being one of the first modern rhythm games. Unbelievably, the American version
		has quite hefty censorship, so if you can’t speak Japanese you should probably go
		for the PAL version.</p>

		<h2>Shingata Kururin PA!</h2>
		<h3><em>Sky Think System, 1996</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">You guessed it, the other Sky Think System game is also here.
		This is naturally a sequel to <i>Kururin PA!</i>, with new mechanics and a lot
		of subsitutions on the ensemble cast. In my opinion this isn’t as good as the
		original, though; the addition of fire pack blocks that turn into fire when
		heated made the learning curve way too steep and without a second player to
		learn together in the versus mode you’ll probably have your arse handed to you
		in the early levels so often that you won’t have much incentive to git gud.
		I’m only saying this because the little I’ve seen spoken about this game shared
		the same sentiment, so maybe there is more weight to my words, but then again
		it might be worthy of note that I consider <i>Puyo Puyo</i> too big brain to
		be enjoyable, so your mileage may very well vary.</p>

		<h2>Turnabout</h2>
		<h3><em>Artdink, 2000</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">As usual for Artdink, this is a really well-polished and zen
		puzzle game, featuring a relaxing soundtrack and background visuals that
		mimic a kaleidoscope. Each level has a board with narrow passages and moving
		parts and the goal is to guide coloured marbles to coloured blocks by turning
		the entire system 90° at a time. I guess it’s a bit like <i>Cameltry</i>, except
		completely different. The game has no timer, just a set par for each level that you
		may or may not choose to aim for, and all moving parts only move in response to
		shifts in gravity caused by you. It’s quite long, but it’s not meant to be
		played in a single sitting at all – like most of Artdink’s output, this is a game
		to sit down, relax and take your mind off your problems.</p>
		
		<p class="desc">The assets pack includes some alternate background ideas taken from
		the game’s files, in case you’d rather have something other than the swimming pool-ish
		tiling I chose.</p>

		<h2>Vadims</h2>
		<h3><em>ITC/Metro, 1996</em></h3>
		<p class="desc">When he was 16, Vadim Gerasimov was an intern at the Dorodnitsyn
		Computing Centre in Moscow, then Soviet Union. There, he worked with Alexey
		Pajitnov right when he was creating <i>Tetris</i>. Gerasimov was the one who ported
		the Electronika 60 original to the more popular IBM PC, and there’s where the
		consensus ends – depending on who you ask, he either helped Pajitnov fine-tune
		the game’s difficulty together with other staff members at the computing centre
		or he was a co-creator of the entire game, almost as important to its making as
		Mr. Alexey himself. Whatever the truth is, the fact remains that Vadim’s name was
		cemented in the annals of video game history when he wrote that IBM PC port that
		spread across the Warsaw Pact and then to the rest of the world through Hungary and
		the United Kingdom, but that’s another story. After <i>Tetris</i>, despite some attempts
		to get into the video game industry, he ended up making his career
		as a programmer, which at the time of this writing he still is – at Google,
		none less. However, in the mid 1990s, at the peak of the falling block craze in Japan,
		he was hired by ITC to design a new puzzle game, and what he came up with was <i>Vadims</i>,
		which might be the only 2.5D falling blocks puzzle game ever. The blocks are 2×1
		units of diagonally-painted cubes, and every time you manage to form a diamond with
		four adjacent cubes, the blocks that include them are
		destroyed whole. The main novelty comes in that you don’t rotate the blocks as
		you would in <i>Tetris</i> or <i>Puyo Puyo</i>: instead, you rotate them along
		their longest axis, tridimensionally. This allows you to leave a block without diagonal
		markings, and if you stack two of the same solid colour together, they become glass and
		can be destroyed by forming a diamond next to them. Let’s not beat around the bush here: this
		game was obviously inspired by Kohs blocks. Even the default colours are the same.
		If you don’t know what those are, <i>good for you</i>,
		I wish I didn’t either, but it’s quite clear that Vadim had taken a dodgy test at
		some point in his life and that’s what came to mind when he was hired to design a

		never gets stale.</p>
