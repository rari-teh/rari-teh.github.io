		<h1>Good Shit I Don&rsquo;t Wanna Lose, part 2</h1>
		<p style="text-align:center;">This is an addendum to a private YouTube list I maintain whose name is self-explanatory. Some videos can’t be added to playlists, chiefly the uploader turning off for no good reason or the incredibly stupid YouTube algorithm deciding that the video is made for kids, also for no good reason. The videos that are too good to lose but also too good to be put on a playlist are now dumped here, in this humble HTML file on a tiny website noöne visits.</p>
